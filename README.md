# Output Random MAC address

The script rand_MAC.py allows you to output a random MAC address.  It can serve as a library to be imported as well.  

## Run Application

In the directory where the script is stored run:

```
python rand_MAC.py
```

If you wish to specify multiple MAC addresses for output, use the -n flag and pass in an integer value for the number of addresses you wish to output (default is 1):

```
python rand_MAC.py -n 10
```

If running properly you should see the number of random MAC addresses you specified to be returned.
